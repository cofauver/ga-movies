[Here find](http://ga-movies.herokuapp.com/) the deployed Heroku version of this project.

Note: IMDB, the source that OMDB uses for the images, has restrictions on the number of images that third party apps can download. While I can see all of the movie images on my local version, the deployed version has been restricted to just a handful of image requests, leaving the Heroku version lacking several images.

This is a first draft of the project that satisfies the requirements set forth in the assignment. I am turning this work in as it is because I want to respect your time needs; there is a limited window between today and the beginning of the course you are hiring for. This work does not, however, meet my own standards in several ways. Here are the important todo's that I would still like to address.

1. Styling: currently the page has apparent visual flaws. For example, the titles are indented on the first line and not after that.

2. Click to open movie details: I'd like to generalize the click to more than just the title. I'd love it if any element (other than the favorite button) within the <li> could not only open the details, but toggle them so they open and close.

3. Writing tests: the package.json file has a testing configuration that is currently unconnected. Adding tests would be ideal.

4. Create users: I would love to have login (even just a simple username login) so that each person could have a favorites list rather than having just one favorites list for the entire app. 


Again, I'd like to emphasize that I really care about displaying the quality of my work. I am not satisfied with the current state of the code, but I want to respect your need for time to review this and decide whether we should move forward. Thanks!
